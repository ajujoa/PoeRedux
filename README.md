## Installation

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/Gineticus/PoeRedux/releases)
2. Download the latest `PoeRedux-win-x64.exe`
3. Run the executable

**Note:** The application is self-contained and includes all required dependencies.

## Verifying Game Files

### For Standalone Client Users

1. Navigate to your Path of Exile install directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Grinding Gear Games\Path of Exile\`)
2. Right-click `PackCheck.exe` and select **Run as Administrator**

### For Steam Users

1. Right-click **Path of Exile** in your Steam Library
2. Select **Properties > Local Files > Verify Game Cache**

**Note:** File verification will restore original game files, removing any applied patches.

## Backups

Before any patch overwrites a game file, PoeRedux saves the original bytes to a local backup file. The **Restore Original** button in the app uses this backup to revert all changes for the currently selected game.

Backups are stored per game under your Windows Local AppData folder:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\PoeRedux\Backups\
    poe1.bak    (Path of Exile 1)
    poe2.bak    (Path of Exile 2)
```

**Note:** If you verify game files via PackCheck or Steam, the backup is no longer needed — you can safely delete the `.bak` file manually.

## System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 version 2004 or later / Windows 11
- **Runtime:** .NET 10.0 Runtime (included in self-contained build)
